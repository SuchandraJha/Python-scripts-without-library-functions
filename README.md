# Python-scripts-without-library-functions
This repositry contains some well-known algorithms and some other stuffs which I have implemented without using library functions.

1. Linear-regression:
This python script performs linear regression without using library function. The data is predefined. Which can be replaced by any other database or user input data.

2. K-means on 3D:
Applying k-means clustering algorithm on 3-dimension without using library function. Number of clusters is given as input by the user. The data is a random predefined dataset, which is broken into 3 lists and plotted in 3 axes. The final clusters can be seen in different colours. For k<=10, the code runs properly. For k>10, the clusters cannot be distinguished by colours. This can be overcomed by adding more colours before plotting, if required.
